The widget-editor is an easy to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) component to explore datasets and create customizable widgets. With it, you can create and edit charts (pie, scatter, bars, etc.) and simple maps.

The widget-editor produces widgets that are serialized as JSON objects, making it easy store and embed them.

The widget-editor is currently used in projects such as [Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/).
