# @widget-editor/rw-adapter

The Resource Watch adapter is an adapter designed specifically to handle datasets, widgets and layers from the [Resource Watch API](https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/). It is currently the only first-party adapter available for the widget-editor, but third-party adapters can easily be created through [this guide](https://github.com/Vizzuality/widget-editor/wiki/Adapters).

To learn more about it, please check [its dedicated page](https://github.com/Vizzuality/widget-editor/wiki/Resource-Watch's-adapter) on the wiki.
